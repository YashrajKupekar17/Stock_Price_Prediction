### Executive Summary
This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for stock price prediction using historical market data. The model demonstrated exceptional performance with a testing R² score of 0.93 and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 2.82% on the test dataset. 
### 1. Introduction
#### 1.1 Problem Statement
Stock price prediction remains one of the most challenging problems in financial analysis due to:
- High market volatility
- Complex dependencies on multiple factors
- Non-linear relationships between variables
- Influence of external events and market sentiment

#### 1.2 Why LSTM?
LSTM networks were chosen for this project because they:
- Can capture long-term dependencies in time-series data
- Mitigate the vanishing gradient problem common in traditional RNNs
- Excel at learning sequential patterns
- Can maintain memory of relevant historical information
